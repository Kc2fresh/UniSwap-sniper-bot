We use BloXroute's streams to listen to liquidity add transaction and call swapExactETHForTokens on Uniswap V2/V3 Router 02 contract. By sending our transaction with the same gas price, we have a very high chance of being very close to the original transaction in the block, hence buying tokens just after liquidity add and just before the price significantly rises.
